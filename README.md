# Malle invariants

This repository contains one main file: Malle.sage. This is a sage script for computing the *a* and *b* invariants in Malle's conjecture. At this time, this code computes Malle's original *b* invariant even though Klüners has shown that it can be incorrect. For details on these invariants, see e.g. Türkelli's article *Connected components of Hurwitz schemes and Malle’s conjecture* [doi: 10.1016/j.jnt.2015.03.005](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnt.2015.03.005).
